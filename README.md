These are the materials for the talk about simulating Mixed-Effects Models in R @ Birmingham University on 12.07.2024. 

The materials can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://github.com/julianquandt/MEM-Sim-Birmingham120724/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

The Rmd file contains the annotated code that was used during the talk. 
The html file is a rendered version of this, that is useful if you only want to read through it without running the code.

The talk is based on my [tutorial on power simulation](https://julianquandt.com/categories/power-analysis/)
